# Understanding-Public-Perception-of-Indian-Economy
This study 📊 delves into the collective sentiment surrounding the Indian Economy 🌐, employing cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques on data sourced from the dynamic social media platform X (formerly Twitter). By dissecting public discourse on GDP, inflation, business, trade, and more, sentiment analysis accurately categorizes opinions as positive, negative, or neutral.

Surprisingly, the public perception is predominantly positive 😃, despite a substantial number of neutral opinions (3608). Business (24.7%) and Economy (22.0%) emerge as hot topics, with macroeconomic policies garnering mostly favorable attitudes. Trade and market sentiments lean towards optimism 📈, while the Business category, particularly "Business India," shines positively.

Addressing social and welfare aspects, the public exhibits a generally favorable stance with minimal criticism. Leveraging TF-IDF feature representation, machine learning algorithms—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extra Tree Classifier—demonstrate a remarkable 93% classification accuracy. These findings not only unveil the public pulse on the Indian Economy but also showcase the robustness of advanced analytics in deciphering vast conversational data. Explore the nuances and insights of India's economic sentiment through this captivating analysis. 🚀
